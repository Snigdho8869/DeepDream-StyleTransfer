# Style Transfer

Neural Style Transfer is a deep learning technique that merges the style of one image with the content of another, creating a new, stylized image. This repository provides an implementation of Neural Style Transfer using pre-trained convolutional neural networks and an optimization algorithm. The implementation is based on TensorFlow and can be used for a variety of artistic and creative applications.

# Requirements:

* Python 3

* TensorFlow 2

* NumPy

* Matplotlib

* PIL 


# Conclusion:

 Neural Style Transfer is a powerful deep learning technique that allows us to merge the style of one image with the content of another, creating a new, stylized image. The technique has a wide range of artistic and creative applications and can be used for generating unique social media content,  creating custom designs for products or merchandise.
